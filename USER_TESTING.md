### Outreach Templates

**TikTok/Instagram DM (Cold):**
```
Hey! Loved your [girl dinner/snack plate] post — that's literally me 3x a week 😅

I'm working on a little project to help people feel good about snack plate dinners and would love to chat with someone who actually does this. 

Would you be up for a 15-min call? I'm not selling anything, just trying to understand the experience better. Happy to send you a $10 coffee gift card as thanks!
```

**Reddit Post:**
```
Title: Looking to chat with fellow "snack plate dinner" people

Hey all! I'm researching the experience of eating snack plates/girl dinners for a side project. 

If you regularly eat cheese + crackers + random stuff as a meal and would be willing to chat for 15 minutes about your experience, I'd really appreciate it. Not selling anything — just want to understand how people approach this.

Happy to send a small thank you (gift card or Venmo) for your time. DM me if interested!
```

**LinkedIn/Personal Network:**
```
Weird ask: Do you know anyone who regularly eats "snack plate dinners"? 

(You know — cheese, crackers, deli meat, random fridge stuff assembled on a plate instead of cooking?)

I'm exploring an idea in this space and looking to chat with 5-10 people who do this regularly. 15-min call, happy to compensate for time.

Drop a comment or DM me if you or someone you know fits the bill!
```

### Incentive Approach

- **Discovery calls (30 min):** $15-20 gift card (Amazon, Starbucks, Venmo)
- **Prototype tests (20 min):** $10-15 gift card
- **Quick feedback (5 min):** No compensation needed

---

## Part 2: Screening Script

### Purpose
Ensure you're talking to the right people before scheduling a full call.

### Screening Questions (DM or Quick Call)

```
Thanks for being willing to chat! Before we schedule, I just want to make sure you're the right fit. Quick questions:

1. How often do you eat "snack plate dinner" — like, cheese and crackers and random stuff instead of cooking? 
   - Looking for: 2+ times per week

2. When you do this, is it usually planned or more "I don't feel like cooking tonight"?
   - Looking for: Unplanned/spontaneous

3. Do you live alone or with others?
   - Looking for: Alone or with partner (no kids)

4. Do you follow any food accounts on Instagram or TikTok?
   - Looking for: Yes, even if they don't cook from them

If they answer "right":
"Perfect, you're exactly who I want to talk to! Let's find a time..."

If they don't fit:
"Thanks for the info! I'm specifically looking for people who do this super regularly, so I'll hold off for now. Really appreciate your time though!"
```

### Disqualifying Signals

- Eats snack plates less than once a week
- Only does this when hosting (not solo)
- Has kids at home (different use case)
- Is a food blogger/creator (different motivation)
- Doesn't follow any food content (not aspirational)

---

## Part 3: Discovery Call Script (Pre-Product)

### Purpose
Understand the problem deeply before showing any solution. Listen more than talk.

### Setup
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Recording:** Ask permission to record
- **Mindset:** You're a researcher, not a salesperson

---

### Script

**[0:00-2:00] Opening**

```
Thanks so much for taking the time to chat! As I mentioned, I'm exploring an idea around snack plate dinners and I want to understand your experience better.

There are no right or wrong answers here — I'm just trying to learn. I might ask some weird questions, just go with it.

Do you mind if I record this? It's just for my notes, I won't share it anywhere.

[Wait for confirmation]

Great, let's dive in!
```

---

**[2:00-10:00] The Last Time (Concrete Example)**

```
Let's start with something specific.

Think about the last time you had a snack plate for dinner — like, cheese and crackers and whatever else. When was that?

[Let them answer]

Walk me through it. What time was it? Where were you? What was happening that day?

[Let them tell the story]

What was on the plate? Just list out everything you remember.

[Write it down exactly]

How did you decide what to put together? Did you plan it, or just grab stuff?

[Listen for: decision process, effort, thought]

How long did the whole thing take, from deciding to eating?

[Listen for: time investment]

Where did you eat it? What were you doing while eating?

[Listen for: context, multitasking, setting]
```

---

**[10:00-18:00] The Emotional Layer**

```
Now I want to ask about how it felt. These might seem like weird questions, but just go with your gut.

When you opened the fridge and saw what you had, what went through your head?

[Listen for: decision fatigue, uncertainty, "what can I make"]

Did you feel like what you had was "enough"? Like, enough for a meal?

[Listen for: validation needs, guilt, uncertainty]

How did you feel *while* eating it? 

[Listen for: satisfaction, guilt, enjoyment, "this counts as dinner" thoughts]

How did you feel *after*?

[Listen for: satisfaction vs. guilt, "I should have cooked"]

Have you ever taken a photo of one of these dinners? Shared it with anyone?

[Listen for: social sharing behavior, pride vs. embarrassment]

Is there anyone in your life who would judge you for eating like this?

[Listen for: external pressure, internal voice]
```

---

**[18:00-25:00] The Pattern**

```
Let's zoom out a bit.

How often would you say you do this? Once a week? More?

[Get specific frequency]

Is it usually a conscious choice, or more of a default when you don't feel like cooking?

[Listen for: intentional vs. fallback]

Are there certain days or situations when it happens more?

[Listen for: triggers — weekdays, late nights, tired]

What's the best snack plate dinner you've ever made? What made it great?

[Listen for: what "success" looks like to them]

What's the worst one? What made it bad?

[Listen for: failure modes — boring, not enough, sad]
```

---

**[25:00-28:00] The Gap**

```
Last few questions.

If you could wave a magic wand and change one thing about how you approach these dinners, what would it be?

[Listen for: the problem they'd solve]

Is there anything that would make you feel *better* about eating like this?

[Listen for: validation needs, presentation, variety]

Do you ever look up ideas for what to put together, or do you just wing it?

[Listen for: existing solutions, search behavior]
```

---

**[28:00-30:00] Closing**

```
This has been super helpful. A few quick wrap-up questions:

If I built something to help with this, would you want to hear about it?

[Gauge interest]

Do you know anyone else who eats like this who might be willing to chat?

[Get referrals]

Thanks so much for your time! I'll send over that gift card right after this. Really appreciate it.
```

### What to Listen For

| Signal | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| "I felt guilty" | Validation is a real need |
| "It was fine" (flat tone) | May not be a strong problem |
| "I took a photo" | Social/aesthetic motivation exists |
| "I just grabbed stuff" | Low effort = feature, not bug |
| "I didn't know what goes together" | Pairing guidance could help |
| "It felt sad" | Elevation/transformation is the value |
| "I wished it looked nicer" | Presentation matters |

### Red Flags

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "I love cooking" | Wrong ICP |
| "I plan my meals" | Wrong ICP |
| "I don't really care what it looks like" | May not value the solution |
| "I just eat the ingredients separately" | Doesn't see assembly as a thing |

---

## Part 4: Prototype Testing Script

### Purpose
Validate that the Aha! moment lands. Watch more than ask.

### Setup
- **Duration:** 15-20 minutes
- **Method:** Screen share (Zoom, Google Meet) or in-person
- **What you need:** Working prototype URL, recording permission

---

### Script

**[0:00-2:00] Setup**

```
Thanks for testing this for me! I've built a very early version of something and I want to see if it makes sense.

A few things before we start:
- I want you to think out loud. Tell me what you're thinking as you go.
- There are no wrong answers. If something is confusing, that's useful feedback.
- Be honest. If it's dumb, tell me it's dumb. I'd rather know now.

I'm going to send you a link and have you share your screen. Ready?

[Send link, confirm screen share]
```

---

**[2:00-3:00] First Impression (Before Interaction)**

```
Before you click anything, just look at the screen.

What do you think this is for?

What do you expect will happen if you use it?

[Don't explain anything. Let them interpret.]
```

---

**[3:00-8:00] Task Completion (Watch Silently)**

```
Okay, go ahead and use it. Imagine it's 8pm on a Tuesday and you're thinking about what to eat.

Remember to think out loud — tell me what you're doing and why.

[Stay silent. Watch. Note:]
- How long does input take?
- Any confusion?
- What do they type?
- Do they hesitate before tapping the button?
```

---

**[8:00-10:00] The Reveal (Critical Moment)**

```
[When the board name appears, watch their face.]

[Note:]
- Do they smile? Laugh? Look confused?
- Do they read it out loud?
- What's their first reaction?

[If they don't react, prompt:]

What do you think of that name?

[If they do react:]

Tell me more about that reaction.
```

---

**[10:00-15:00] Debrief Questions**

```
Okay, let's talk about what just happened.

What did you think of the board name it gave you?
- Scale of 1-5, how much did you like it?
- What would make it better?

[If Phase 2+ with tips:]
What did you think of the tips?
- Were they helpful?
- Would you actually do them?

[If Phase 2+ with wildcard:]
What about the "level up" suggestion?
- Do you have that item at home?
- Would you actually add it?

Did the experience make you feel any different about what you have in your fridge?

Would you use this again?

Would you show this to a friend?

What would you change?

What's missing?
```

---

**[15:00-18:00] Comparative Questions**

```
If this didn't exist, what would you do instead?

Have you ever used any other app or website for meal ideas?

How does this compare to just Googling "what to do with brie and crackers"?
```

---

**[18:00-20:00] Closing**

```
Last question: In one sentence, what is this product?

[See if they get it]

Thanks so much! This was incredibly helpful. I'll send your gift card right after this.
```

Hey! I built a quick prototype and would love 5 minutes of your feedback.

Here's the link: [URL]

When you try it:
1. Think about what's in your fridge right now
2. Type those ingredients
3. Tap the button
4. Tell me your honest reaction to what you see

You can reply here with your thoughts, or record a quick Loom back. Specifically:
